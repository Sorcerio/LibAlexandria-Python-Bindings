There once was a language named Python,
With syntax that was quite a delightin'.
Its simplicity grand,
Made code easy to understand,
And testing, oh boy, it was excitin'.

From parsing to data manipulation,
Python handled it all with elation.
With libraries galore,
And a community to adore,
It became the coder's salvation.

Test cases were a breeze to create,
Python's elegance, they did appreciate.
From unit tests to mocks,
They could catch all the blocks,
And ensure their code was first-rate.

So if you're in need of a language to parse,
Python's the one that'll make you amass.
With its coolness and flair,
You'll find joy in the air,
And your test cases will surely surpass.
